# Non overlap disclosure

We are submitting a Next Step Grant for the minimal storage and retrieval path, and an Open Grant for the public index and documentation. Scopes do not overlap.

- Open Grant milestone one references the Next Step release and does not claim any work already funded there.  
- If both are approved we will adjust schedules to avoid double funding.
