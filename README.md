## Quick start

**Today**

If you don't have pnpm installed
`npm i -g pnpm`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm node scripts/hash_file.js ./docs/sample.txt
```

**After agreement â€” delivered in Milestone 1**
```bash
pnpm run record:sample   # stub now; real path ships in M1
pnpm run upload:sample   # stub now; real path ships in M1
