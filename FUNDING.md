# Funding

## Sources
- Filecoin Dev Grants  Next Step Grant  request 8,000 USD
- Filecoin Dev Grants  Open Grant  request 36,000 USD

## Use of funds
Funds cover engineering time, verification, documentation, and small external contributions bounties for mirrors and rebuilds. No marketing spend. People never pay fees.

## No overlap
Work funded by the Next Step Grant will not be claimed again in the Open Grant. Track B M1 references the Next Step release and creates new outputs only.

## Disbursement
Payment after agreement and acceptance of each milestone. We do not claim payment for work done before activation.

## External contributions
We may pay small fixed bounties for accepted verification runs, mirrors, and documentation fixes. All payouts are listed in `docs/proof` with links to the deliverable.

## License
MIT for all outputs.
